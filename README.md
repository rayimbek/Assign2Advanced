  The key difference between static and dynamic memory allocation is that in static memory allocation once the memory is allocated, the memory size is fixed while in dynamic memory allocation, once the memory is allocated, the memory size can be changed.
  A dynamic variable can be a single variable or an array of values, each one is kept track of using a pointer. After a dynamic variable is no longer needed it is important to deallocate the memory, return its control to the operating system, by calling "delete" on the pointer.
